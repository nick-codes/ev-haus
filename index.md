In 2019 we saw the work of [EV West](http://evwest.com) and thought it
was so cool we just had to get involved. We thus decided to start
EV Haus to save these classic cars from the scrap yard by converting
them to electric vehicles.

We have owned classic VWs for decades and have always done our own
work on these amazing vehicles. That said, we recognize that parts for
this classic cars are getting harder and harder to find, and the
climate crisis warrents saving these electric vehicles by converting
them to electric.

We have thus decided to enter the world of EV conversions and save
these vehicles by converting them from under performing, gas guzzling
oil leaking beasts, into clean running, high performance vehicles.

We are committed to performing only bolt in conversions, allowing
owners to return their vehicle to stock, should they so decide. That
said, once you experience the performance electric can provide there
is no go backing!

Contact [Sales](mailto:sales@ev.haus) today to convert your existing
vehicle, purchase a new vehicle to convert, or to see conversions
we have for sale.
